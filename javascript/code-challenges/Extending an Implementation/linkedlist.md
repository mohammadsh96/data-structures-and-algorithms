# linked-list-insertions
[LinkedList.js file](linkedlist.md)
A linked list is a way to store a collection of elements. Like an array these can be character or integers. Each element in a linked list is stored in the form of a node.
A node is a collection of two sub-elements or parts. A data part that stores the element and a next part that stores the link to the next node.
A linked list is formed when many such nodes are linked together to form a chain. Each node points to the next node present in the order. The first node is always used as a reference to traverse the list and is called HEAD. The last node points to NULL.

## Challenge

my code :
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

append
arguments: new value
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
insert before
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
insert after
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified
## Approach & Efficiency
i tried to make the Big O as lowest as i can by using while loop instade of for loop as example
and making my code shorter as i could

Big O for time = O(n)
Big O for space = O(1)
