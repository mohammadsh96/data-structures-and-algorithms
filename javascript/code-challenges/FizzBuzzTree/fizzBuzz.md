# Challenge Summary

✔ [main README.md](../README.md)

Write a function called fizz buzz tree that take tree as argument and return new array with the values If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz” If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz” If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz” If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, turn the number into a String.

## Approach & Efficiency

the node class and the BinaryTree class is from last challenge

i create the fizzBuzzTree function that take tree as argument

then if statment to check the root

if the root is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”

If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”

If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”

If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, turn the number into a String

## Solution

[code](fizzbuzz.js)

## test

to run the test : `npm test fizzbuzz`
